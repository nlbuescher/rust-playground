## Linked List

The list is singly linked, is implemented using `Option<Box<Node<T>>>`, and is written exclusively in safe rust. It supports the following functionality:
- iteration.
- push and pop, both front and back.
- insertion and removal at a given index.
- splitting off a new list starting at a given index.
- peeking values at front or back, both mutably and immutably.
